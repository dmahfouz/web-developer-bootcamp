# The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020

## Intro

- This repo contains notes and code for Udemy's 'The Web Developer Bootcamp (2020)'
- This repo is for learning purposes only, as a reference to all materials learnt.

## Important notes

- This course has been updated as of October 2020
- Since this course was last accessed ~ August 2020, many sections have been changed and some added or removed
- As a result, in order to avoid treading old ground (re-learning HTML/CSS sections), I will be picking up from the JavaScipt sections and revisiting the new HTML/CSS content at a later date
- A branch `update/oct-2020-version` has been made to not lose any changes from previous version
