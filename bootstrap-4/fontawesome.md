# Font Awesome CDN Links

We will be using a font/icon library called Font Awesome. Font Awesome can now be found at https://fontawesome.com/

Use the following CDN link for the latest version:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.11.2/css/all.css">
```

Meanwhile, if you're using Glyphicons instead of Font Awesome, but the icons aren't showing up and a rectangle shows instead, then see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksZfPOgsC4w).

Lastly, if your hamburger menu button is broken and you're using jQuery 3.5.0 then please revert to the previous version, 3.4.1:

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
```

as the recent release of 3.5.0 came with some breaking changes and won't be fixed until 3.5.1 is released.
